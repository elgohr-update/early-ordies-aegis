🔥 The Aegis Wallet is a quick web wallet used to move small amounts of crypto quickly. On page load an Ethereum keypair is automatically generated and used to sign transactions with an incredibly simple interface. Sending funds is as easy as a QR code scan.

🌊 Aegis Wallet is similar to the Burner Wallet but rather than using the relatively centralised xDai sidechain, it instead allows free near-instant transactions on the Aegis NOCUST commit chain. This means that your funds are secured by the main Ethereum network in a non-custodial fashion. As it is non-custodial, no matter what happens to Aegis you can always withdraw your money back to the Ethereum mainnet!_

💵 Burners are analogous to cash: quick and easy but less secure. You wouldn't stuff thousands of dollars in your pocket on the way out the door at night, don't trust a seed phrase in localstorage with more than you are willing to lose.

🎫 Using [paper wallets](https://github.com/austintgriffith/paper-wallet), [ether.cards](https://ether.cards/), or solidcoins, users can be instantly onboarded into a wallet and have tokens or localcoins to purchase goods or services.

🏠 Don't forget to sweep funds to colder storage when you get home at night and burn your ephemeral keys!

💸 Press the `[Request]` button to instantly create a popup point-of-sale system and have a QR code to display in the window of your shop. Patrons can send you funds with [a simple scan in seconds](https://youtu.be/neZeaXAnkAg).

🌉 Press the `[Bridge]` button to move ETH or AUSD that you have sent to your burner onto the Aegis Hub.

🗝️ If you would like more permanence, press the `[Advanced]` button and [use a short pass phrase](https://youtu.be/3zAFo-8p_tg?t=48) to seed a keypair. 

✅ All projects should have a 'burner' version of their product. Take simple fundamentals from your app and put them in an easy to access web version before the barriers to entry. Use this to educate your users about your product and incentivize them to take the next step and download your app. 

🙏 Thanks to Austin Griffith, the original creator of the [Burner Wallet](https://github.com/austintgriffith/burner-wallet) which this is based on.

## Where can I use the Liquidity Burner Wallet?

* Tartarus testnet: [tartarus.spear.technology](http://tartarus.spear.technology)

The Tartarus testnet runs an Aegis hub which runs with a shorter checkpoint round time (5 minutes instead of 36 hours). This allows easier testing of withdrawals as two checkpoints need to pass before funds become available on the blockchain.
