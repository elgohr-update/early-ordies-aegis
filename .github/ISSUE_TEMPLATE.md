## How to create a new bounty?

1. Create an issue with  SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time bound) description.
2. Add the bounty to the "TO DO" collumn of the bounty board: https://github.com/austintgriffith/burner-wallet/projects/1
3. Drop a message about the proposal in telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/KByvmROSyXhuMESDUL5YVA
4. If all questions were answered and/or no objections raised for 2 days, the bounty is considered approved. The "bounty" tag is added and the bounty moved to "Available" collumn on the bounty board.

## Bounty sizes
size-XS 200 DAI
size-S  350 DAI
size-M  550 DAI
size-L  900 DAI
size-XL 1400 DAI

keep in mind: the bounty amount is split between the gardener, worker and reviewer according to the ratio defined in the issue description.


## Bounty Challenge
If bounty has no progress for 4 days, then anyone can challenge the bounty (add a comment to issue). Once the bounty is challenged, the worker has 3 more days to deliver a WIP PR. If worker fails to make progress within stated period, the bounty moves back to "Available" column and is up for grabs by anyone.
