# Aegis

A secure, scalable, and non-custodial Ethereum L2 powered by the Reserve RToken platform.

Aegis is a mythical shield in Greek mythology that protected Zeus and Athena in battle. In a similar fashion, the Aegis L2 is designed to protect users and their funds while they are conducting finance and commerce in an increasingly adversarial environment.

We envision a world where no one is unbanked and where anyone can participate in the global financial system that is fast, cheap and transparent while keeping custody of their money. To achieve our vision, we shall combine two powerful and synergistic technologies: the [Reserve protocol](https://reserve.org/en/protocol/) and the [NOCUST commit-chain](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/commit-chains/).


# Demo

To try out the basic functionality of Aegis, check the aegis-demo folder on this repo:

https://github.com/spear-protocol/aegis/tree/main/aegis-demo


# System Summary

Aegis has two main components:

1. Aegis Commit-chain - A chain of commits to the NOCUST smart contracts on Ethereum by centralized but trustless operators running the Aegis Hub server. The operators facilitate gas-less transactions off-chain without taking custody of user funds. 

2. Aegis USD (AUSD) stablecoin - an RToken that is designed to protect the funds of normal users who we envisage to be regular everyday people through collateral diversity and collateral default insurance. The fees for transacting on Aegis will be paid using AUSD.


# Aegis Commit-chain

Based on the [NOCUST commit-chain](https://docs.liquidity.network/background) technology developed by Liquidity Network. It is tightly integrated with the Aegis USD that serves as its native token to solve the drawbacks of the original NOCUST implementation.

An Aegis Hub is a server that is run by an operator to interact with the Aegis commit-chain. It is a fork of the [NOCUST Hub server](https://github.com/liquidity-network/nocust-hub).


## NOCUST Pros and Cons

Benefits:
1. Non-custodial L1 Security 
2. [Unbounded Scalability](https://docs.liquidity.network/costs)
3. Superior User Experience

Drawbacks:
1. Weak Tokenomics
2. Lack of EVM Compatability

# Aegis USD (AUSD)

Prioritizes safety and capital preservation.
Collateral basket will be composed of currently available tokens across Compound and Aave:
```
   cDAI
   cUSDC
   cUSDT
   cUSDP
   cBUSD
   aDAI
   aUSDC
   aUSDT
   aUSDP
   aBUSD
```

# RTokens x NOCUST

RTokens unleashes the potential of the NOCUST concept by improving the project tokenomics and wrapping DeFi into stablecoins circumventing the need for the L2 EVM. This provides a better user experience through fast and cheap transactions and by preserving composability on L1.
